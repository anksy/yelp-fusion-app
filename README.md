## How to start server
After cloning this repo, install the dependencies and then run npm start command. Make sure to config constant file if necessary.

### `npm start`

This app uses 4000 port.

## Yelp Fusion Business Logic
Yelp Fusion API business logic is placed in `./server/controller/business.controller.js` and `./server/services/yelp.fusion.service.js` files.

*Note: /app folder contains React Application Code. If you change the backend host/port other than localhost/4000, then you need to update the constant file for React project and re-build the react app again.*
